# Integrating ULTRA and Trip-Based Routing
This C++ framework contains a variant of the Trip-Based Routing algorithm that was combined with ULTRA in order to enable efficient journey planning in multi-modal transportation networks.
Both the preprocessing algorithms and the query algorithm have a special focus on integrating unlimited paths in the transfer graph and the Trip-Based query algorithm.
The framework was developed at [KIT](https://www.kit.edu) in the [group of Prof. Dorothea Wagner](https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/).

## Usage

This framework contains code for generating Trip-Based transfer shortcuts using two alternative approaches. First, shortcuts computed by ULTRA can be used as input for the standard Trip-Based preprocessing algorithm. Secondly, an integrated variant of the ULTRA and Trip-Based preprocessing steps can be used to directly compute the Trip-Based transfer shortcuts. Additionally, the framework contains code for the ULTRA-Trip-Based query algorithm, which computes Pareto-optimal journeys when given the transfer shortcuts generated by either of the preprocessing approaches. Finally, the framework contains code for the standard transitive variant of the Trip-Based query algorithm and the ULTRA-RAPTOR algorithm for comparison. All components of the framework can be compiled into a single console application, using the ``Makefile`` that is located in the ``Runnables`` folder. Within this application the following commands are available:

* ``buildCH`` computes a normal CH needed for the ULTRA query algorithms.
* ``coreCH`` computes a core-CH need for the preprocessing steps.
* ``computeEventToEventShortcuts`` computes stop-to-stop ULTRA shortcuts needed for the ULTRA-RAPTOR query and the sequential preprocessing.
* ``raptorToTripBased`` converts stop-to-stop ULTRA shortcuts to Trip-Based ULTRA shortcuts using the sequential preprocessing.
* ``computeEventToEventShortcuts`` computes Trip-Based ULTRA shortcuts using the integrated preprocessing.
* ``generateUltraQueries`` generates random triples of source location, target location, and departure time.
* ``generateGeoRankQueries`` generates random queries, grouped by their query distance (geo-rank).
* ``runUltraQueries`` evaluates a query algorithm on queries generated with the commands above.

All of the above commands use custom data formats for loading the public transit network and the transfer graph. As an example we provide the public transit network of Switzerland together with a transfer graph extracted from OpenStreetMap in the appropriate binary format at [https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/PublicTransitData/Switzerland/binaryFiles/](https://i11www.iti.kit.edu/PublicTransitData/Switzerland/binaryFiles/).

## Literature

The algorithms in this framework are mainly based on two previously published algorithms: ULTRA and Trip-Based Routing.
